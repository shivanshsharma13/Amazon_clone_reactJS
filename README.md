# Amazon_clone_React_JS

![Main GIF](main.gif "Main")

This is a copy of the world famous e-commerce webiste i.e. Amazon. Just tried my react js skills to make real world applications, hence the original is build with angular js.

## Key Points

- This is only the frontend and no backend used
- Not fully copied amazon as there are lots of stuff and it will takes several time
- Add to basket functionality
- Subtotal functionality
- No reloading (Power of React)
- Total Items in basket functionality

## Clone the project

```
git clone
cd amazon_clone_React_JS
npm i
npm start
```
